### Course Outlines

The following is based of the [senate policy on course outlines](http://www.smu.ca/webfiles/8-1012_SenateCourseOutlines.pdf) at Saint Mary's University.

Students must be adequately informed of the following:
1. topics covered and learning outcomes
2. how their grade will be assessed
3. methods of instruction
4. important dates (tests, exams, projects)
5. required and recommended readings
6. course prerequeisites or recommendations

Feedback is incredibly important to both Students and Instructors.
The following dates represent milestones where awareness of course evaulation will help students make informed choices.

I am creating the course outline in LaTeX. It follows the SMU course outline guidelines.
I am considering making it open source along with a great deal of the other course content and code.
